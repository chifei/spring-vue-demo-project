        <p>The star of one of my favorite shows ever, The Magicians, unexpectedly dies in the season four finale. Among the handful of fans on my Twitter feed, people were either sharing very obvious spoilers or bemoaning them.</p>
        <p>And you know what? Honestly, it doesn’t matter to me. Quentin is dead, and that’s sad, but knowing that going into the show didn’t affect how much I enjoyed the finale. In fact, it may have made me appreciate it more. Research shows that spoilers don’t have the negative impact many of us assume they do.</p>
        <p>Yet absolute terror of spoilers abounds across the internet. On Twitter, people treat spoiler warnings like alerts that you’re about to drive into a radioactive fallout zone. Entertainment websites plaster spoiler warnings on articles, rightfully terrified of the hordes who rage against anything they recognize as the vaguest plot detail. And spoiler sections of podcasts abound: On Vanity Fair’s excellent podcast devoted to the HBO show Sharp Objects, producers included a nearly 30-second long recording of pig sounds to denote that the hosts would be discussing the Gillian Flynn book that inspired the show.</p>
        <p>But the fury over spoilers has never been more relevant than it is now, with the opening of Avengers: Endgame and the last season of Game of Thrones.</p>
        <blockquote>The study found that readers actually significantly preferred spoiled stories over those that were not spoiled.</blockquote>
        <p>Last week, when someone leaked a five-minute clip of Endgame, fans were “miserable,” according to the Verge. “For all those people who posted and shared that video I assure you that you have special place in Hell [sic],” one Facebook commenter wrote. The film’s directors, brothers Joe and Anthony Russo, posted a letter to Twitter begging fans “#DontSpoilTheEndgame” in order to preserve the movie’s “surprising and emotionally powerful conclusion.”</p>
        <p>But all these supposedly miserable, panicked fans can relinquish their fear, because in all likelihood, spoilers won’t ruin the movie. In a 2011 study out of University of California San Diego — one of only a handful of studies on the subject of spoilers — 819 students were asked to read spoilers at various points while reading short stories by authors like John Updike, Agatha Christie, and Raymond Carver. These tales were divided into three genres: “ironic twist stories,” “mysteries,” and “literary stories.” The study found that for all three story types, readers actually significantly preferred spoiled stories over those that were not spoiled.</p>
        <p>In a 2013 follow-up study, the researchers investigated why spoilers don’t seem to have a negative effect on consumer enjoyment. They wanted to know what was compelling people to feel more positively towards the spoiled stories: Was it because the spoiler made the story easier to read and understand? Because it increased aesthetic appreciation? Or was it because it delivered, quite clearly, on reader expectations?</p>
        <p>The authors found that spoilers made the stories easier for readers to comprehend, and also caused them to like the stories more — though they had little impact on how readers felt about a story’s style or artfulness. Once again, this was true regardless of whether the story hinged on a twist ending, as in a murder mystery or science fiction story, showing that the success of even so-called “plot-driven” narratives might not hinge entirely on their endings.</p>
        <p>“We asked lots of people, ‘Do spoilers ruin experiences for you? The vast majority of people say ‘yes,’” says Nicholas Christenfeld, a psychology professor at UC San Diego and one of the study’s authors. But “the term is wrong… we’re not watching these things for the ending.”</p>
        <blockquote>Perhaps fear of spoilers, like many fears, is predicated on a heavy dose of irrationality: I don’t want to know how it ends, on the off chance that it’ll end up badly.</blockquote>
        <p>Lest you think these findings might only apply to books and not film or television, another study, published in the journal Media Psychology in 2018, produced similar (but not identical) results. It found that while spoilers have a small and negative impact on viewer enjoyment on comedy films — which the study authors speculate is because jokes rely on punch lines — they had a very slightly positive affect on how much viewers liked “fantasy thriller” films such as Captain America. It also found that — and this is relevant for Game of Thrones fans — source “familiarity,” such as when a viewer knows the outcome of a show because they’ve read the book that inspired it, caused the viewer to enjoy the show more. Yet when the show diverged from the source material, the viewer liked it less.</p>
        <p>Perhaps fear of spoilers, like many fears, is predicated on a heavy dose of irrationality: I don’t want to know how it ends, on the off chance that it’ll end up badly. Research from 2017 found that people wouldn’t want to know their own future, regardless of whether that future was filled with sadness or joy. The study found that out of more than 2,000 German and Spanish adults, only 1% consistently wanted to know their own futures. These statistics applied even to smaller events, like the outcomes of soccer matches or what they’d be receiving for Christmas.</p>
        <p>I’m not one of these people. It’s probably that I’m so driven by anxiety that if I know how something will turn out, I can breathe and focus on what’s happening now. Knowing that Quentin was going to die let me focus on how the show built up to that event. It made room for paying attention to how characters reacted and deciphering the logic behind their choices. Far from spoiling my experience, the spoiler let me enjoy the show more.</p>
        <p>This also helps explain why I’ve watched the first three seasons of The Magicians three times. There’s a distinct joy to be found in repetitive viewing, as a small and oddly beautiful study from 2011 discovered. The results of interviews with 23 New Zealanders found that revisiting films, novels, or geographic places not only helped the study subjects understand the source material more thoroughly, it also helped them understand themselves and their own growth with each revisit.</p>
        <p>“We find that reconsuming can be an extraordinary experience, filled with the emotional luxury of delight, novel sensations, and intellectual insight,” write the study authors. “Reconsumption is a petition, a form of actively seeking, a way of asking for something from the past, a way of becoming rather than returning.”</p>
        <p>If spoilers can in fact render a narrative more comprehensible and enjoyable, and if, in fact, watching something again makes room for immense pleasure and understanding, both of the self and of the story, then what, exactly, are we so afraid of? Are we waiting solely for narrative events to line up like good little soldiers? Is the only reason we’re watching a show or reading a book to elicit a gasp at a twist in the tale?</p>
        <p>We all have our own preferences, and not wanting to know an outcome is as fair a desire as any. But in the entertainment content economy, that desire dominates, stifling conversation and relegating discussion to walled-off corners marked with big red hazard signs. Perhaps those who are anti-spoilers, rather than imposing their stringent needs on everyone else, can take responsibility for themselves.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of things you can do to hide spoilers from your timelines, but if you do happen to come across one, don’t panic. You might end up loving Avengers: Endgame even more.</p>
